# Project Requirements
**_Do not modify this file; it is for your reference only._** 
- Do the final project individually ‚Äì‚Äì without a partner.
- You should make your edits to README.md while working on your project.

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏èProject Overview

1. Choose a homework asssignment, teamwork assignment, or example code.
2. Reimplement the code in object-oriented style.
3. Implement mouse or keyboard interaction via event handling. All interaction must be through the program, not the Python console.
4. Add additional features to the project.

You can choose from any previous assignment or code from this class, 
including code we gave you as examples (e.g., palindromes), 
code you modified (e.g., DNA), or code you built from scratch 
(e.g., Draw something that makes you smile). You can even combine multiple
assignments together to create something new and interesting!

## Kanban Board
- Make a Kanban board board on Trello to track the progress of your project.
- Your board needs to have at least the following three columns:
    - **To Do / Backlog:** All tasks related to the project that you plan to complete
    - **Doing / Work In Progress:** The ONE or TWO task(s) you are currently working on (move the card from Not Started to In Progress when you begin that task).
    - **Done**: Tasks that you believe are implemented and work correctly.
- As an example, you can refer to the Kanban board used by the Student Software Development Team, which is slightly more complex, but contains the three columns listed above: https://trello.com/b/eRuoLEBR/ssdt-kanban-board
- Feel free to add additional columns that you find helpful.
- Post at least a dozen project-related tasks to the board.
- Sort the tasks into the columns.
- Prioritize the tasks within each column.
- Update the board continuously throughout the project: 
    - Every time you start working, look at your Kanban board to figure out which task to begin. 
    - Every time you stop working, update your Kanban board with any progress you made. 
    - Do NOT wait until you are submitting milestones to update the board. 
- Post a link to the board in the README.md document.

## üìåMilestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design
*Due Fri Mar 12, 2021*

1. Create your project repository (this one!) 
2. Update the README.md header with your information (name, etc.)
3. Indicate which assignment(s) you plan to use for your project.
4. Copy the original files from those assignments into this repository.
    - Make sure that Git tracks these files. (In PyCharm, the filenames should *not* be red; you should also see them on GitHub after pushing.)
    - _**Do not modify these files! They are for reference only!**_
5. Create a CRC card for a class your project will implement:
    - Include an image of this CRC card in your README.md file.
    - See my example for how to do this.
    - Verify on the GitHub website that your README.md is formatted appropriately to show your image.
6. **Commit and push** your work.
7. Update your Kanban board with your progress continuously.

## üìåMilestone 2: Code
*Due Tue Mar 16, 2021*

1. Create and add the new file(s) to your repository for your final project code.
2. Complete a rough draft of your code! Hints:
    - Begin by creating the outline of the class(es) you need for your project.
    - Initialize any class variables and attributes. Give them initial values, or **None**.
    - Create stubs for methods that aren't written yet, but you know you'll need. This is also a good time to move code from your reference files, or refer to them as you refactor.
    - After that code is fully functional, add event handling.
3. **Commit and push** your work often.
4. Update your Kanban board with your progress continuously.

## üìåMilestone 3: Virtual Check-in
*Due Tue Mar 23, 2021*

1. Add a note to the Milestone 3 section of the README.md that indicates what percentage of the project you have left to complete, and how confident you feel about completing the work. Elaborate.
2. Now is the time to reconsider goals. Add a new column to your Kanban board between **To Do / Backlog** and **Doing / Work in Progress**. Call this column **Final Sprint**. Move cards from the **To Do / Backlog** column into the **Final Sprint** column that you expect to finish by the end of the project, and leave anything that is extra in the **To Do / Backlog** column. 
3. In the **Final Sprint** cards, put due dates on each card for when you think they need to be done to complete the project.

## üìåMilestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo
*Due on Fri Mar 26, 2021*

1. Final version of your code:
    - Clean up code. Ensure it follows our coding standards.
    - Remove any non-working code. Your program MUST execute without syntax or runtime errors.
    - Comment out any print statements or other scaffolding code. All interaction must be through the program, not the Python console.
    - Clean up docstrings and comments.
2. Final, fully completed version of your README.md
    - All sample text / instructions below headings replaced with your own writing.
    - Proofread, nicely formatted, and cleaned up.
    - Check how your formatting looks in a web browser (not PyCharm's unformatted version).
    - Your README will be graded as it appears on GitHub.
3. In-class live lightning demo to your classmates
    - You will demonstrate your project. Have your project ready to **run** at the beginning of class. No scrolling through code, and not a PowerPoint.
    - You will have three minutes to demo. No more, no less.
    - There will be a short amount of time for question and answer.
4. **Commit and push** your work before your section's exam period.
